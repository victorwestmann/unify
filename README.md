Unify
=====

This project is a tribute to the new company (funded 15/OCT/2013) called Unify (former Ex Siemens Enterprise Communications).


Who should use it?
------------------
Anyone that's interested.


What applications will I need to create my custom mande Unify screensaver?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Instastorm (www.instantstorm.com) which is freeware
- Adobe Flash CS 6.0 (www.adobe.com) which costs a whole lot of money! ($$$)

-Inkscape 0.48/+
Alternatively, to edit the 3 imagems from the current Unify screensaver you should only need Inkscape 0.48 (or any other SVG vector graphics editor. Illustrator, Corel DRAW! or other might do the job).


What is this all about?
-----------------------
Unofficial Unify (Ex Siemens Enterprise) screensaver remake.


Fonts
-----
In the SVG file a very similar font was used ("Gulim") to mimic official screensaver(and website actually) font that's called "Harmony".

Hope you all enjoy and feel flatered by this little project as a way of desiring the new company good luck!
