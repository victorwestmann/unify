Unify
=====

This project is a tribute to the new company (funded 15/OCT/2013) called Unify (former Ex Siemens Enterprise Communications).


Who should use it?
------------------
Anyone that's interested.


What applications will I need to create my custom mande Unify screensaver?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

- InstantStorm (www.instantstorm.com) which is freeware
- Adobe Flash (www.adobe.com) which costs a whole lot of money! ($$$)

- Inkscape

Alternatively, to edit the 3 imagems from the current Unify screensaver you'll only need Inkscape 0.48 (or any other SVG vector graphics editor. Illustrator, Corel DRAW! to do the job).


What is this all about?
-----------------------
Unofficial Unify (Ex Siemens Enterprise) screensaver remake.


Fonts
-----
In the SVG file a very similar font was used ("Gulim") to mimic official screensaver(and website actually) font that's called "Harmony".

Hope you all enjoy and feel flatered by this little project as a way of desiring the new company good luck!
